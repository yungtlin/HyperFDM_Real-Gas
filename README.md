Finite difference-based hypersonic CFD code with 8-species equilibrium real gas model for UCLA2024 MAE250F class project. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the capability of the finite difference method in studying the real gas effect on the aero/thermodynamic performance of a hypersonic blunt body vehicle. The technical details of the implementation are included in the [report](MAE250F_Project_Report.pdf).
